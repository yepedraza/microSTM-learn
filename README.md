# Microcontroller STM32F7 series projects
 -----
This repository has some useful codes for the analog read and processing of sensors, PWM driver for electrical motors and more. There are base codes that can be modified for an especifical use. This codes were created in the software KeiluVision5 for the before mentioned card. For the implementation of these codes I used a series of electronic modules adapted for this card.
Any comment is apreciated.
